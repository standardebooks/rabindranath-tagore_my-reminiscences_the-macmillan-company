				<p epub:type="title">The Rains and Autumn</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>According to the Hindu calendar, each year is ruled by a particular planet. So have I found that in each period of life a particular season assumes a special importance. When I look back to my childhood I can best recall the rainy days. The wind-driven rain has flooded the verandah floor. The row of doors leading into the rooms are all closed. Peari, the old scullery maid, is coming from the market, her basket laden with vegetables, wading through the slush and drenched with the rain. And for no rhyme or reason I am careering about the verandah in an ecstasy of joy.</p>
			<p>This also comes back to me:⁠—I am at school, our class is held in a colonnade with mats as outer screens; cloud upon cloud has come up during the afternoon, and they are now heaped up, covering the sky; and as we look on, the rain comes down in close thick showers, the thunder at intervals rumbling long and loud; some mad woman with nails of lightning seems to be rending the sky from end to end; the mat walls tremble under the blasts of wind as if they would be blown in; we can hardly see to read, for the darkness. The Pandit gives us leave to close our books. Then leaving the storm to do the romping and roaring for us, we keep swinging our dangling legs; and my mind goes right away across the far-off unending moor through which the Prince of the fairy tale passes.</p>
			<p>I remember, moreover, the depth of the <span xml:lang="bn-Latn">Sravan</span><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-55" id="noteref-55" epub:type="noteref">55</a> nights. The pattering of the rain finding its way through the gaps of my slumber, creates within a gladsome restfulness deeper than the deepest sleep. And in the wakeful intervals I pray that the morning may see the rain continue, our lane under water, and the bathing platform of the tank submerged to the last step.</p>
			<p>But at the age of which I have just been telling, autumn is on the throne beyond all doubt. Its life is to be seen spread under the clear transparent leisure of <span xml:lang="bn-Latn">Aswin</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-56" id="noteref-56" epub:type="noteref">56</a> And in the molten gold of this autumn sunshine, softly reflected from the fresh dewy green outside, I am pacing the verandah and composing, in the mode <span xml:lang="bn-Latn">Jogiya</span>, the song:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>In this morning light I do not know what it is that my heart desires.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The autumn day wears on, the house gong sounds 12 noon, the mode changes; though my mind is still filled with music, leaving no room for call of work or duty; and I sing:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>What idle play is this with yourself, my heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>through the listless hours?</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Then in the afternoon I am lying on the white floorcloth of my little room, with a drawing book trying to draw pictures⁠—by no means an arduous pursuit of the pictorial muse, but just a toying with the desire to make pictures. The most important part is that which remains in the mind, and of which not a line gets drawn on the paper. And in the meantime the serene autumn afternoon is filtering through the walls of this little Calcutta room filling it, as a cup, with golden intoxication.</p>
			<p>I know not why, but all my days of that period I see as if through this autumn sky, this autumn light⁠—the autumn which ripened for me my songs as it ripens the corn for the tillers; the autumn which filled my granary of leisure with radiance; the autumn which flooded my unburdened mind with an unreasoning joy in fashioning song and story.</p>
			<p>The great difference which I see between the rainy-season of my childhood and the autumn of my youth is that in the former it is outer Nature which closely hemmed me in keeping me entertained with its numerous troupe, its variegated makeup, its medley of music; while the festivity which goes on in the shining light of autumn is in man himself. The play of cloud and sunshine is left in the background, while the murmurs of joy and sorrow occupy the mind. It is our gaze which gives to the blue of the autumn sky its wistful tinge and human yearning which gives poignancy to the breath of its breezes.</p>
			<p>My poems have now come to the doors of men. Here informal goings and comings are not allowed. There is door after door, chamber within chamber. How many times have we to return with only a glimpse of the light in the window, only the sound of the pipes from within the palace gates lingering in our ears. Mind has to treat with mind, will to come to terms with will, through many tortuous obstructions, before giving and taking can come about. The foundation of life, as it dashes into these obstacles, splashes and foams over in laughter and tears, and dances and whirls through eddies from which one cannot get a definite idea of its course.</p>
